# Airplane Tickets Reserving System
Language: C++

This project simulates the current online reservation and ticketing systems. 
It maintains a small database (files-based) of airplanes’ seats and let user reserves them. 
The system either reserves the seats, gives the receipt with various prices, and flies the plane when full; 
or it puts the selected seats onto the waitlist of their associated plane if those seats are already reserved. 
The prices are based on the type of seat(s) and the user’s age.
